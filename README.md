# Excel_Sales_Anlysis_Dashboard

In this Excel I have analysed and created a Dashboard using Excel to Identify the Insights of the Virnda Store...

Objective:
  Virnda Store wants to create an Annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda can understand their customer and grow more sales in 2023.

Questions:
1. Compare the Sales and orders using single chart.
2. Which month got the highest sales and orders?
3. who purchased more: men or women in 2022?
4. what are the different order status in 2022?
5. list top 5 states contributing tot he sales?
6. relation between age and gender based on number of orders.
7. which channel is contributing to maximun sales?
8. highest selling category?.


To analysis this I have created a column in a dataset called "Age Group" using IF formula in Excel... it will categorise the age group of the people like "Senior", "adult", "Teenager".
then i have created a column called "Month" to check the total sales in every month in the year 2022.

Sample Insights:
1. women are more likely to buy compared to men (~ 65% )
2. MH, KA and UP are the top 3 states (~35% )
3. Adult age group (30 - 49) is max contributing (~ 50% )
4. Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80% )


Final Conclusion:
Target the women customers of age group 30 to 49 yrs who is living in MH, KA and UP by showing some ads/offers/coupons available from the Online stores like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.

Thank you.
